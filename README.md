# AI-Driven-ER-Overcrowding-Reduction-via-Predictive-Analytics

## Predictive Analytics, Resource Optimization & Patient Flow Management

This project tackles one of healthcare‚Äôs most critical challenges: emergency room (ER) overcrowding. Using machine learning, process optimization, and data-driven scheduling, we forecast patient arrivals, optimize resource allocation, and reduce wait times to improve healthcare delivery and operational efficiency.


## üîç Problem Statement
Emergency rooms globally face severe overcrowding, leading to long wait times, poor patient outcomes, staff burnout, and increased operational costs. This project addresses these challenges by leveraging predictive analytics and optimization techniques to build scalable, AI-powered solutions.


## üéØ Project Objectives
- Predict patient influx with high accuracy
- Optimize staff and equipment allocation
- Reduce ER wait times and increase throughput
- Provide a real-time framework for hospital decision-making


## üõ† Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- ML Models: Random Forest, Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting
- Queueing Theory, Discrete Event Simulation
- Linear Programming (Resource Optimization)
- Tableau / Power BI (optional for visual dashboards)
- Data Source: Synthetic ER logs, patient arrival trends


## üîç Key Features / Methods
- **Predictive Analytics**: Forecasting patient arrival patterns and identifying high-risk cases
- **Queueing Models**: Reducing wait time using ML + queueing theory
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic staffing via Linear Programming
- **Discrete Event Simulation**: Testing staffing & triage configurations
- **Scenario Planning**: Real-time dashboards + "what-if" forecasting


## üìà Outcome & Impact
- Reduced patient wait time by up to **30%**
- Improved staff efficiency through real-time resource reallocation
- Increased patient throughput by **15%**
- Enhanced hospital decision-making with real-time simulations
- Helped prevent avoidable patient deterioration due to delays
